I made this cheat sheet for git terminologies and most common commands when I was learning git.

- **Repository** is a directory where your project/files are stored which are used to interact with Git.

- **commit** this is when you make one or more changes to a file in git.

- **branch** creates a new line of development. This is mainly used to continue working without messing with the mainline of development.

- **git commit** is used to commit changes to your git repo. Commit contains a message which is used to describe what changes you've made.

- **staging area** this is where git will put/store files while waiting for you to commit the file containing the changes.

- **SHA** this is a unique ID number that is given to each of your commits.

- **git init** is used to initialize your project into a repository.

- **git clone** is used to copy an existing repository to your computer.

- **git checkout** takes you to a different branch in your repo.

- **git branch** is used to create a new branch.

- **git checkout -b** is used to create a new branch and automatically switch to it.

- **git status** shows you the current status of your repo like files which are yet to be committed or the branch you are currently in.

- **git push** sends all your commits to the Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket repo you have created.

- **git pull** fetch all your files from your repo and integrate them with your local repo. I mostly use it to make sure everything is up to date and working correctly.

- **git add** is used to add files from the working directory to the staging area.

- **git diff** is used to display the differences between two versions of a file also you can see changes that are yet to be committed using this command.

- **git merge** is used to combine changes from different branches together.

- **git revert** is used to revert a specific commit. It is usually followed by the commit SHA to indicate which commit you want to reverse.
