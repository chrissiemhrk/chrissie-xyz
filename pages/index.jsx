          I've always loved computers and the internet, ever since I was a kid.
          I was in high school when I built my first program for a Computer
          Science class. I fell in love with it and I decided right then and
          there that programming would be my future.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 font-light">
          The first language I learned was Scratch, and after that came C and
          Python. After taking a few classes in high school, though, I ran into
          a problem: the curriculum didn't cover web development at all. So I
          searched the internet for courses to learn web development and came
          upon FreeCodeCamp, where I taught myself the fundamentals of frontend
          web development.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 font-light">
          Now I work as a frontend developer at Ossix Technologies, where we're
          building 2u Money â€” a financial platform that lets users send money to
          anybody, anywhere in Africa. In my free time, when I'm not reading
          manga or watching YouTube videos (or k-dramas), you can find me
          experimenting with new web technologies, writing for my blog, and
          studying as much as possible about frontend design and development!
